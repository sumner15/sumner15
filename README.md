I am a Della Martin Postdoctoral fellow in the division of biology and biological engineering (BBE) at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

ðŸ”­ My research goal: to give abilities back to those whoâ€™ve lost them. I use my background in engineering and neuroscience to design neuroprosthetics and brain-machine interfaces. Previously, I was an NSF graduate research fellow studying human-robot interaction in a mechanical and aerospace engineering program. I got my start in haptic robotics & theoretical physics and computation.
