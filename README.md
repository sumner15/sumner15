I am the CEO of [Forest Neurotech](www.forestneurotech.org). 
I still do things at Caltech and AE Studio. 

Iâ€™m creating next-generation neurotechnologies to bridge the gap between human biology and humanityâ€™s technological progress.

I trained in Physics, Mechanical Engineering, and Neuroscience. Some Computer Science and Communications along the way.
